# Chapter 6: Skeletal System: Bones and Bone Tissue

## Key Topics and Learning Outcomes

---

### 1. Functions of the Skeletal System
- **Components**: Listing bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.
- **Functions**: Supporting the body, protecting organs, allowing body movements, storing minerals and fats, and blood cell production.

---
### 2. Cartilage
- **Importance**: Understanding cartilageâ€™s role in the skeletal system structure.
- **Structure**: Describing hyaline cartilage.
- **Growth**: Explaining appositional and interstitial growth types.

---
### 3. Bone Histology
- **Bone Matrix**: Components include collagen (flexible strength) and hydroxyapatite (compressional strength).
- **Bone Cells**: Listing osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, their functions, and origins.
- **Bone Types**: Describing woven (collagen fibers in many directions) and lamellar bone (organized in parallel lamellae).
- **Bone Structures**: Differences between compact (dense with few spaces) and spongy bone (with trabeculae and spaces).


---

### 4. Bone Anatomy
- **Bone Classification**: Classifying bones by shape.
- **Long Bone Structure**: Labeling parts of a long bone (diaphysis, epiphysis, medullary cavity, periosteum, endosteum).
- **Other Bone Types**: Structural differences between long, flat, short, and irregular bones.


---

### 5. Bone Development
- **Intramembranous Ossification**: Developing skull bones, mandible, and clavicles from membranes.
- **Endochondral Ossification**: Most bones develop from cartilage models; primary and secondary ossification centers.


---

### 6. Bone Growth
- **Length and Width**: Processes of bone growth in length (epiphyseal plate) and width (appositional growth).
- **Factors**: Genetics, vitamins D and C, growth hormones, estrogen, and testosterone.

---

### 7. Bone Remodeling
- **Need**: Remodeling converts woven to lamellar bone, adjusts bone shape, repairs, and regulates calcium levels.
- **BMU**: Basic multicellular units' role in remodeling.
- **Mechanical Stress**: Effects on bone remodeling and strength.

---

### 8. Bone Fracture Classification and Repair
- **Fracture Types**: Classifying fractures by mechanism, soft-tissue damage, displacement, pattern, and fragment number.
- **Repair Process**: Steps in bone repair from hematoma formation to compact bone replacement.

### 9. Calcium Homeostasis
- **Role of Bone**: Maintaining calcium levels.
- **Hormonal Influence**: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases calcium; calcitonin decreases calcium.

## Key Themes

### 1. Structure and Function
- **Dynamic Nature of Bone**: Emphasizing bone as a dynamic tissue with vascularity, nerve supply, cell types, and matrix.
- **Bone Functions**: Protection, support, movement, mineral reserve, and blood cell production.

### 2. Homeostasis
- **Calcium Homeostasis**: Critical for skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Understanding regulation of blood calcium levels.

### 3. Cell Theory and Biochemistry
- **Bone Cells**: Osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts' functions and importance for bone health and calcium homeostasis.

### 4. Changes Through Time
- **Aging Effects**: Quality and quantity of bone matrix change with age, affecting weight-bearing capabilities and flexibility.
- **Interconnected Systems**: How skeletal system changes affect other organ systems.
