Hello! I'm Justin Howard, a passionate educator and lifelong learner with a deep love for anatomy and physiology. I believe in making complex topics accessible, engaging, and meaningful for all students. My goal is to inspire curiosity and encourage critical thinking through each lesson.

In this course, we'll explore the fascinating world of anatomy and physiology, breaking down each concept to build a strong understanding and appreciation for how everything connects. Whether you're just starting or looking to deepen your knowledge, I'm here to guide and support you throughout the journey.
