# Objectives
- Provide an Introduction to Epithelial and Connective Tissues and Skin
- Explore the Physiology of the Skin
- Understand Nursing Care Knowledge in Skin-Related Conditions, such as Burns and Blistering Disorders

# Overview of Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa
- **Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**: A group of inherited skin disorders
- **Subtypes**:
  - EB Simplex (EBS)
  - Junctional EB (JEB)
  - Dystrophic EB (DEB)
  - Kindler Syndrome
- **Focus**: Dystrophic EB, particularly the recessive form (RDEB)

# Pathogenesis of RDEB
- **Genetic Basis**: Mutations in the COL7A1 gene
- **Molecular Mechanism**:
  - Deficiency or dysfunction of Type VII Collagen
  - Poor anchoring fibril formation leading to fragile skin

- **Impact**:
  - Epidermal-dermal separation, blistering, and scarring

# Clinical Features
- **Symptoms**:
  - Fragile skin, blistering, erosions
  - Mucosal involvement, esophageal strictures
  - Scarring and fusion of fingers/toes (pseudosyndactyly)
- **Complications**:
  - Increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma
  - Variability: RDEB-GS (Generalized Severe) vs. RDEB-GO (Generalized Other)

---

# Current Management Strategies
- **Wound Care**:
  - Non-adhesive dressings, minimize trauma
- **Multidisciplinary Approach**:
  - Dermatologist, Pediatrician, Gastroenterologist, etc.
- **Supportive Care**:
  - Nutritional support, psychosocial care, cancer screening

---

# Future Therapies
- **Gene Therapy**:
  - Correcting COL7A1 mutations
- **Fibroblast Cell Therapy**:
  - Injecting healthy fibroblasts to produce collagen
- **Bone Marrow Stem Cell Therapy**:
  - Regenerating skin and reducing blistering
- **Protein Therapy**:
  - Delivering Type VII Collagen to the skin

---

# Summary and Conclusion
- RDEB is a severe skin disorder with significant morbidity
- Current management is supportive; however, innovative therapies show promise
- Continued research is critical for future treatment options
